## 3. Field Rules (Output)

In GraphQL fields are used to describe the shape of data that will be transferred from the server to the client. They may be described as scalar types as well as complex structures - Object type (GraphQLObjectType).

- **3. Field Rules (Output)**
  - [3.1.](./output-semantic-names.md) Use semantic names for fields and avoid leaking of implementation details in fields names.
  - [3.2.](./output-non-null-output.md) Use `Non-Null` field if field will always have a given field value.
  - [3.3.](./output-grouping.md) Group as many related fields into custom Object type as possible.
